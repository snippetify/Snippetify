# Snippetify
[Snippetify](https://snippetify.com/) allows you to save, share and search snippets.

## What it does
**Snippetify** allows developers to share and save as many snippets as possible on the platform ([Snippetify](https://snippetify.com/)) for free. Sharing can be done on Snippetify and even extend to social networks.

Snippet backup can be done from **Snippetify** or directly on the website where the snippet is located or from the text editor.
It also allows you to access, use and exploit snippets in different ways. You can access the snippets from your text editor, you can embed it in your web pages and your readers can interact with it by bookmarking it and even giving it a like from your web page. In addition, when you make a change to a snippet from **Snippetify**, it is propagated to all the web pages where the snippet was embedded.

**Snippetify** provides a public API for snippets to extend the possibilities of exploitation and use.

**Snippetify** allows you to do deep searching by sending its robot scraping the web to find the snippet you are looking for.

The main (web) application is very ergonomic and user-friendly.

With **Snippetify** the possibilities are so endless that you cannot do without.
